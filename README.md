_Version 2.1_    

Android concept app for Design4Nature, week 2.
This is a proof-of-concept app for the inter- and post-game experience of the project. 

Essence: the app can be used non-intrusively for parents or caretakers to guide throughout and between the games.  

Apart from that there's also potential for analytics and whatever.  

### Current functionality

- progress tracking  
- built-in debugging tools  
- (physical) level-to-level navigation  
- local leaderboards
