_Version 0.1._    

Android concept app for Design4Nature, week 2.
This is a proof-of-concept app for the mobile aspect of the project.  

Essence: the app can be used non-intrusively for parents or caretakers to guide throughout and between the games.  

Apart from that there's also potential for analytics and whatever.
